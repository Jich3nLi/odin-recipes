    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> You'll need about a cup of sugar for the cookie dough
                , plus about two tablespoons of sugar for rolling the dough balls.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour gives the cookies structure and helps 
                create a tender texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices:</strong> These soft gingerbread cookies are spiced with ginger, cinnamon, 
                and cloves.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking soda:</strong> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it makes 
                the dough rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Butter is great for making perfectly soft ginger cookies with 
                slightly crisp edges. If you'd like, you can substitute margarine.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg adds moisture and acts as a binding agent (it holds the dough 
                together).</li>
            <li><strong>Molasses:</strong> Molasses lends warm, cozy, and sweet flavor to these soft gingerbread 
                cookies.</li>
        </ul>
