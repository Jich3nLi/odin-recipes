    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless pork chops, <small>3/4</small>-inch thick</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li><small>1/2</small> cup cooking oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Do not pat chops dry, so seasonings and flour will stick.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of pork chops with salt and pepper, then 
                sprinkle with flour on both sides. Use the back of a spoon 
                to distribute the flour over the entire surface.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat 
                until it shimmers. Carefully add pork chops and pan fry 
                until brown, about 4 minutes. Do not disturb the chops until 
                ready to turn.</li>
            <li>When you see the edges of the chops turn brown, turn, and pan 
                fry the other side until no longer pink on the inside and 
                brown on the outside, an additional 4 minutes. An instant-read 
                thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F 
                (63 degrees C). Reduce heat, if they are browning too quickly. 
                Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
